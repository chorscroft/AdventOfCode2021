# Advent Of Code 2021

Repo for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) event for 2021.

I'll be storing the code in the [R directory](https://github.com/chorscroft/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/R) with a single file for each day.

If you have any questions or comments about my code please feel free to tweet me [\@ClareHorscroft](https://twitter.com/ClareHorscroft)

Happy coding!
